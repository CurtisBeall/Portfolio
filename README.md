# Single-Page-Template
Responsive, single page template with modals, smooth target anchor scrolling and scroll to top elements.

# Additional Notes
This template was created from HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Refactored to jQuery) and PHP in an effort to make an efficient user experience.  All content is brought to the user through modals and anchor points, rather than the user going to the content on different pages.

The site is fully responsive and all icons are implemented as SVG's with PNG fallbacks.
